Make sure to lower **Max Priority Fee** and also **Max Fee**. 
I have safely claimed with as little as 70 gwei but it took approximately 8 hours for the transaction to be accepted. 
Once you have adjusted the numbers hit save and then you can confirm your transaction.

Now that you have a building placed on the Gameboard you need to add your humans to it so that they can get their extra 20% earnings.

1. Head to your building that you just placed on the board and this time when you click on it you will be presented with a different UI for adding humans to your office.
1. Pick the three humans you want to add to your office and submit your transactions.
